# Blockchain Integration Architecture

#tech #concept #blockchain

## Overview
Multi-chain integration architecture supporting NFT assets, developer marketplace, and player economy.

## Blockchain Infrastructure

### Primary Chains
1. **Internet Computer Protocol (ICP)**
   - Smart contract deployment
   - Developer tools hosting
   - AI service integration
   - Asset storage and delivery

2. **ATOM/Cosmos**
   - Cross-chain interoperability
   - Token bridge infrastructure
   - Inter-blockchain communication
   - Transaction validation

3. **GALA Network**
   - Gaming-specific features
   - NFT marketplace integration
   - Player rewards system
   - Asset ownership tracking

## Technical Components
