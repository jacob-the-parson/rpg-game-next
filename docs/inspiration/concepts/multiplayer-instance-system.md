## Overview
A dynamic multiplayer instance management system with seamless transitions between private and shared spaces.

## Core Components

### Instance Types
1. **Private Instances (Homes)**
   - Individual player homes
   - Personal customizable space
   - No other players allowed
   - Entry point for players after login

2. **Shared Instances (Town)**
   - Central hub for player interaction
   - Portal system for adventures
   - Dynamic player count management
   - Meeting point for group formation

3. **Adventure Zones**
   - Dynamic sharding system
   - Player count balancing
   - Auto-scaling based on population

## Technical Architecture

### Shard Management
- Dynamic shard creation/deletion
- Player count monitoring
- Automatic player redistribution
- Empty shard cleanup
- Failsafe mechanisms for low-population shards

### Flow Sequence
1. Login Screen
2. Character Selection/Creation
3. Home Instance Load
4. Town Hub Access
5. Adventure Zone Selection

### Performance Targets
- Maximum players per shard: TBD
- Minimum players per shard: TBD
- Shard merge threshold: TBD
- Split threshold: TBD
