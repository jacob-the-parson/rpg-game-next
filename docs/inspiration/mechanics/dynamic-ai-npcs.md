## Overview
A system for creating and managing NPCs powered by latest-generation AI models, with a developer interface for easy management and configuration.

## Core Features

### NPC Management System
1. **Character Card System**
   - Customizable personality traits
   - Behavioral parameters
   - Memory and context management
   - Relationship tracking
   - Quest/interaction capabilities

2. **Developer Interface**
   - Web-based management portal
   - Real-time NPC configuration
   - Model switching/updating
   - Performance monitoring
   - Interaction logging

3. **AI Model Integration**
   - Pluggable AI model architecture
   - Easy model switching
   - Version control for prompts
   - Performance optimization
   - Fallback systems
