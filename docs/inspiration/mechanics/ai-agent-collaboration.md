# AI Agent Collaboration System

#mechanic #tech #ai

## Overview
A virtual environment where AI agents collaborate on game development tasks through a visual interface, inspired by ChatDev and modern multi-agent systems.

## Core Components

### Agent Roles
1. **Development Team**
   - Project Manager
   - Game Designer
   - Programmer
   - Artist
   - QA Tester
   - Documentation Specialist

2. **Specialized Agents**
   - Asset Creation Agent
   - Code Review Agent
   - Performance Optimization Agent
   - Bug Detection Agent
   - Content Generation Agent

### Visual Interface
