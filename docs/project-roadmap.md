# RPG Game Next - Project Roadmap

## Current Status Summary

The project has achieved several key milestones:

- **Technical Foundation Complete**
  - ‚úÖ Next.js 15.2.3 with React 19 setup
  - ‚úÖ Excalibur.js integration
  - ‚úÖ Basic game scene rendering
  - ‚úÖ Development environment configuration
  - ‚úÖ GitHub repository setup with SSH

- **Asset Pipeline Progress**
  - ‚úÖ Character Generator tool integrated
  - ‚úÖ Asset organization structure defined
  - üöß Character sprite implementation in progress

- **Backend Development**
  - üöß SpacetimeDB integration (currently using mock data)
  - üìù Planned multiplayer features
  - üìù Planned AI NPC system

## Immediate Priorities

### 1. SpacetimeDB Integration

- [ ] Implement real-time position updates
- [ ] Add basic multiplayer interactions

### 2. Player Character System
- [ ] Implement character sprite rendering
- [ ] Add character animation states
- [ ] Create smooth movement system
- [ ] Set up character customization UI
- [ ] Implement collision detection

### 3. Game World Development
- [ ] Create initial game map
- [ ] Add basic environment interactions
- [ ] Implement camera system
- [ ] Add basic UI elements (health, inventory, etc.)

## Next Phase Goals

### 1. AI NPC System
- [ ] Design NPC behavior system
- [ ] Implement AI conversation system
- [ ] Create NPC pathfinding
- [ ] Add basic quest system

### 2. Multiplayer Features
- [ ] Add player-to-player interactions
- [ ] Implement chat system
- [ ] Create party system
- [ ] Add basic trading mechanics

### 3. Game Systems
- [ ] Implement inventory system
- [ ] Add basic combat mechanics
- [ ] Create progression system
- [ ] Implement save/load functionality

## Technical Considerations
