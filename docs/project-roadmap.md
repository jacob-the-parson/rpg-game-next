# RPG Game Next - Project Roadmap

## Current Status Summary

Based on the documentation review, the project has:

- **Strong Technical Foundation**
  - Next.js 15.2.3 with React 19 setup
  - Excalibur.js selected as the game engine
  - Planned integration architecture documented

- **Comprehensive Documentation Base**
  - API integration guidelines (OpenAI, Claude, Ollama)
  - Asset organization structure 
  - Game architecture concepts

- **Innovative Game Concepts**
  - AI-powered NPCs
  - Dynamic narrative systems
  - Developer marketplace

## Recommended Next Steps

### 1. Implementation Roadmap
- [ ] Create a phased development plan with clear milestones
- [ ] Prioritize core gameplay features vs. advanced AI features
- [ ] Establish measurable success criteria for each milestone

### 2. Technical Documentation
- [ ] Complete the multiplayer documentation with implementation details
- [ ] Document data flow between Next.js and Excalibur.js components
- [ ] Create API diagrams showing connections between all systems
- [ ] Document build and deployment processes

### 3. Game Design Documentation
- [ ] Define the core gameplay loop
- [ ] Document player progression systems (levels, skills, achievements)
- [ ] Create a comprehensive game world guide (maps, locations, NPCs)
- [ ] Establish game balance parameters and metrics

### 4. Asset Management
- [ ] Implement the planned asset organization structure
- [ ] Create art style guidelines and technical requirements
- [ ] Set up a tracking system for asset creation/acquisition
- [ ] Document asset pipeline for optimization

### 5. Prototype Development
- [ ] Define initial prototyping goals
- [ ] Create technical requirements for minimum viable prototype
- [ ] Establish testing procedures for gameplay mechanics
- [ ] Set up a CI/CD pipeline for builds

### 6. AI Integration Plan
- [ ] Develop a cost model for API usage in different scenarios
- [ ] Create fallback systems for offline play
- [ ] Document prompt engineering best practices specific to game context
- [ ] Set up monitoring for AI response quality and performance

### 7. Team Documentation
- [ ] Create onboarding guides for new team members
- [ ] Document development environment setup
- [ ] Establish coding standards and PR processes
- [ ] Set up knowledge sharing and documentation processes

## Immediate Action Items

1. **Establish the core game architecture**
   - Implement basic Excalibur.js integration with Next.js
   - Set up initial scene management structure
   - Create core game state management

2. **Develop the first playable prototype**
   - Implement basic character movement and controls
   - Set up a simple test environment/map
   - Establish basic game loop

3. **Set up asset pipeline**
   - Organize existing assets according to the documented structure
   - Implement asset loading and optimization
   - Create a simple character and environment

## Long-term Vision

The project aims to create an innovative RPG experience leveraging modern web technologies and AI capabilities. Key long-term objectives include:

- Creating a seamless blend of traditional RPG gameplay with AI-enhanced narrative
- Building a platform for user-generated content and AI-assisted game design
- Establishing a multiplayer ecosystem with both collaborative and competitive elements
- Developing AI agents that can adapt to player behavior and preferences

## Technical Debt Considerations

While pursuing innovation, be mindful of these potential technical debt areas:

- AI API costs at scale
- Multiplayer synchronization complexity
- Asset loading optimization for web performance
- State management across complex game systems
