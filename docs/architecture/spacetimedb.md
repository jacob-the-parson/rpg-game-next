# SpaceTimeDB for Game Development

## Overview
SpaceTimeDB is a unique database system that combines both database and server functionality into one. It's specifically designed for real-time applications like games, offering high performance and simplified architecture.

## Key Features

### Performance
- Extremely low latency (~100 Î¼s/Tx)
- High throughput (~1,000,000 Tx/s)
- In-memory state with persistent commit log
- 5,000,000 updates per second capability

### Game-Specific Features
- Real-time player position updates
- Built for massive multiplayer games (powers BitCraft MMORPG)
- Time-travel capability (full transaction history)
- Real-time subscription queries
- Perfect for game state synchronization

### Architecture Benefits
- No separate game server needed
- Clients connect directly to database
- Built-in authorization and permissions
- Serverless deployment
- Automatic scaling
- No need for:
  - Docker
  - Kubernetes
  - VMs
  - Microservices
  - Complex ops infrastructure

### Technical Features
- ACID compliant
- Relational database structure
- SQL-style query language
- Real-time subscription queries
- Point-in-time rollbacks
- Transaction log replay
- State snapshots
- Secure atomic transactions

## Language Support

### Server-side
- Rust (Primary)
- C# (Experimental)
- TypeScript (Planned)
- Python (Planned)
- C++ (Planned)
- Lua (Planned)

### Client-side
- Rust
- C#
- TypeScript
- Python (Planned)
- C++ (Planned)
- Lua (Planned)

## Implementation Strategy for Our RPG

### Game State Management
1. Player positions and movement
2. NPC states and behavior
3. Combat system
4. Inventory management
5. Quest progress
6. World state

### Real-time Features
1. Player movement synchronization
2. Combat interactions
3. Chat system
4. Player interactions
5. World events

### Data Models
```sql
-- Example schema structure
CREATE TABLE Players (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    position_x FLOAT,
    position_y FLOAT,
    health INT,
    state TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE NPCs (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    type TEXT,
    position_x FLOAT,
    position_y FLOAT,
    state TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE WorldState (
    region_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    state JSON,
    last_updated TIMESTAMP
);
```

## Security Considerations
- Built-in authentication (OIDC)
- Programmable permissions
- Secure atomic transactions
- Public key identities
- Delegated authority

## Monitoring and Debugging
- Full transaction history
- Point-in-time rollbacks
- State snapshots
- Transaction log replay
- PostgreSQL OLAP queries for analytics
