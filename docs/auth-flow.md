# RPG Game Authentication Flow Analysis

## Current Implementation Issues

### 1. Connection Flow
- ✅ SpacetimeDB connection is working correctly
- ✅ WebSocket connection established successfully
- ✅ Identity is being generated and stored
```typescript
// Example from logs:
identity: "c2001de06fc8301f66be738045ae8969fc9131fd66a4f217349b43da0903960b"
```

### 2. Login Flow Issues
- ❌ Login button incorrectly uses registration flow
- ❌ Empty username being passed to registration
```typescript
// Current problematic implementation
register(""); // This is incorrect usage
```

### 3. Database Issues
- ❌ Character table not available
- ❌ User data loading but finding 0 characters
```typescript
[Warning] Character table not available
[Log] Found 0 characters: []
```

## Required Changes

### 1. Authentication Flow
1. Separate login and registration flows
2. Implement proper username collection
3. Add proper error handling for missing/invalid credentials

### 2. Database Setup
1. Ensure character table is properly initialized
2. Verify table subscriptions are working
3. Add proper error handling for missing tables

### 3. User Experience
1. Add proper form validation
2. Show loading states during authentication
3. Display meaningful error messages to users

## Current Flow (from logs)

1. Initial Load:
   - Connects to SpacetimeDB
   - Generates new identity
   - Attempts to load user data
   - Fails to find character table

2. Login Attempt:
   - Triggers registration instead of login
   - Passes empty username
   - Successfully connects but finds no characters

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Fixes Needed:**
   - Implement proper login flow separate from registration
   - Fix character table initialization
   - Add proper username collection

2. **Code Structure Changes:**
   - Create separate login and registration components
   - Implement proper form handling
   - Add proper state management for auth flow

3. **Database Changes:**
   - Ensure character table exists and is properly initialized
   - Add proper table subscriptions
   - Implement proper error handling for database operations

## Questions to Resolve

1. What is the intended difference between login and registration?
2. How should character creation be tied to user registration?
3. What authentication state needs to be persisted?
4. How should multiple characters per user be handled?

## Security Considerations

1. Ensure proper validation of usernames
2. Implement proper session management
3. Add rate limiting for registration/login attempts
4. Consider adding password/authentication token system
