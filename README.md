   ```

2. Start the local SpacetimeDB server:

   npm run spacetime:start
   ```

3. Deploy the backend module:
   ```bash
   npm run spacetime:deploy
   ```

## Asset Setup

The game uses custom sprite assets located in `/public/assets/`. To set up your character:

1. Navigate to `/public/assets/characters/`
2. Use the provided Character Generator tool in `/public/assets/tools/` to create custom sprites
3. Export sprites to the appropriate directory
4. Update character configuration in `/src/game/config/character.ts`
